## Brief game description:
As the Wordle game has become a world phenomenon on the Internet recently, similar games started to pop up. One of them is Nerdle, a math-based world-puzzle game created by Richard Mann. We aim to recreate that game, but included some twists to add a touch of uniqueness to our ruleset. The name "Algeble", is a combination of "Algebra" and "Wordle", which instead of deducing a hidden word, players need to deduce a hidden algebraic expression.
## Standard Game rules:
The machine will randomly generate an algebraic expression with an integral result from 100 to 999. Your goal is to deduce the algebraic expression and obtain the result of the expression with minimum amount of clues, which you get every turn. During a turn, you are required to type an algebraic expression that must result in a number randomly generated by the machine, different from its. The machine then compares your expression with its and gives you a “Wordle format” clue (See below for details). You then use the clues to help deduce the machine’s original algebraic expression. Unlike Wordle or Nerdle, your goal is not to type out the deduced algebraic expression out as doing so is impossible given that both expressions yield different results. Rather, you need to deduce the expression in your head. Once you are confident enough in deducing the expression (as well as its result), you will have 1 chance to enter the result of expression and you win if you get it correct, else you lose :( Additionally, extra logic (see Custom Game settings for details) is applied to give more clues to the player.

Wordle format clue:
The clue consists of symbols "O", "X" and "#" with the same length of the algebraic expression, each corresponding to the existence and correctness of position of the character at that postition. "O" represents that the character exists and is in the right position with respect to the hidden expression. "#" represents that the character exists in the hidden expresssion but in different position. "X" represents that the character does not exist in the hidden expression. There may be repeated characters within the same expression. In that case, any character(s) in the correct position will first be represented with a "O", when there are an additional examples of the character in both the guess and the answer (but not in the right place), characters will be represented by "#" from left to right in the guess expression until the amount of "#" and "O" of that expression matches the total number of that character in the hidden expression (or until all the characters are represented by "#"s). The remaining extra digits in the guess expression are represented by "X". 

## Variant Game rules:
The variant gamemode is similar to the standard gamemode, but players will only get 5 maximum rounds but 99 guesses. Players are expected to use all rounds but a minimum of guesses to obtain the result of the expression.
## Custom Game settings:
When creating a custom game, a variety of custom settings can be selected by the user:
* Length of algebraic expression

Players can choose 8-10 as the length of the algebraic expression
* Equation generation method

* Maximum round count

* Guess count

* Extra logic

* Generated expression redundacy

* Guess expression redundacy

* Clue analysis

* Repeated guesses

## Implemented features:
* Random expression generation

* Custom equations

* Game structure

* Different display modes
A detailed display mode can be selected by new players to adapt with the input requirements, while a simple display mode can be selected to minimize display length.
* Continue game
A function to load a previously on-going game saved in a .txt file
* Load gameseed
A gameseed is a 13-digit string that uniquely identifies all custom settings of a game. 2 games with the same gameseed have the same settings and random variables but can be played differently. Players can share the gameseed once they encounter an interesting game.
* View High Score
High scores are setted for standard and variant 
* Show all clues

* Surrender function

* Error handling

## Code requirements
* Generation of random game sets or events\n
The function 

* Data structures for storing game status
A string array is used to store user's guesses and clues during the game
Several variables are used to store game settings 
A .txt file is used to store game status so the game can be loaded back after a game crash
* Dynamic memory management
There is dynamic memory allocation when players chooses to use custom equations. A 0-sized dynamic array is first created before reading through a chosen .txt file to get valid expressions. Everytime a valid expression is detected, the size of the array will be expanded and that expression will be added to the dynamic array. After closing the .txt file, an expression of specified length will be randomly drawn from the dynamic array as the hidden answer.

* File input/output
There is file input when players chooses to use custom equations. Players can prepare a set of equations for the game and the function genCF() will choose a random valid equation from the corresponding .txt file in the custom_equation directory
There is also file input when players choose to view the high scores, the program will read and output the data in the coresponding .txt file in the highscore directory to the screen
There is file modification when a player breaks the high score in a standard or variant game, the coresponding .txt file in the highscore directory will be updated accordingly.
* Program codes in multiple files
Our main program, consisting of XX self-defined functions is separabled into XX .h and .cpp files
